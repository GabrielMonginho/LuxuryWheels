**Simulated rental car website**

Hello World! I have a project to share with you! Here I had the challenge to build a simulated rental car website from the beginning. I will present you my company, Luxury Wheels! The proposal here is to develop a rental car management website where the clients will be able to register and to rent one or many cars.

The client should be able to:

## Register and authenticate
- Client should choose his category according to the car category he wants to rent (Gold, Silver, or Economic)

## Search for vehicles according to categories:
- **Category**:
  - Gold (Daily price: 29€)
  - Silver (Daily price: 15€)
  - Economic (Daily price: 8€)
- Brand
- Model
- Type (Car, SUV, Motorcycle)
- Passengers number
- Doors number
- AC
- Fuel
- Baggage

## Define rental start date and end date
## Choose the form of payment and finish the order
## Change the start date and end date or full cancellation after the payment with all price adjustments
## Check out

Now let's play with the website:
- **Access the market page** by clicking on the main page 'GET STARTED' button or 'BUY NOW' button on the pricing section.
- It's also important to notice that clients are not allowed to **rent any car with a category higher than their category**, and if he tries, he will receive a warning message.
- Any kind of **register error** will be noticed by a warning message.
- Any **wrong date inserted** will be rejected with a warning message.
- If a client tries to pay with the **shop cart empty** will be noticed.
- The renting price of each car according to the rental period time will be shown on the payment page.
- The final rental price will be shown on the payment page.
- Vehicles become unavailable if the date of the last mandatory **inspection** is greater than 1 year or if the date of the next **service** is expired.
- After the rental order is done, the client will find a button on top of the website called 'Your cart' to get the page where he will be able to do the changes, check-out, or cancellation.
- In the bottom of the car page, there is a **'Related products'** section where the client will see some other similar cars. If he refreshes the page, these examples will change randomly.
- The **payment page** is not official so is not needed to fill in the payment card numbers. Just the form of payment is mandatory to register all the payments done by the platform.
- During the car rental period the car is not available on the website until it finishes.
- In the database, all movements will be correctly registered, like the form of payment, rental values, all the users, orders, and cars will be matched when a rental is done.

I hope you enjoy my site as much as I did! :)
