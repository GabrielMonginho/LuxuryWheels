Simulated rental car website

Hello World!
I have a project to share with you!
Here I had the challenge to build a simulated rental car website from the beginning. I will present you my company, Luxury Wheels!
The proposal here is to develop a rental car management website where the clients will be able to regist and to rent one or many cars.

The client should be able to:

# Register and authenticate
    - Client should choose his category according to the car category he wants to rent (Gold, Silver or Economic)

# Search for vehicles according to categories:
    - Category:
        Gold (Daily price: 29)
        Silver (Daily price: 15)
        Economic (Daily price: 8)
    - Brand
    - Model
    - Type (Car, Suv, Motorcycle)
    - Passengers number
    - Doors number
    - AC
    - Fuel
    - Baggage

# Define rental start date and end date
# Choose the form of payment and finish the order
# Change the start date and end date or full cancellation after the payment with all price adjustments
# Check out

Now let's play with the website:
    - **Access the market page** by clicking on main page 'GET STARTE' button or 'BUY NOW' button on pricing section.\n
    - It's also important to notice that clients are not allowed to **rent any car with category highter than them category**, and if he tries, he will receive a warning message.
    - Any kind of **register error** will be noticed by a warning message.
    - Any **wrong date inserted** will be rejected with a warning message.
    - If client tries to pay with the **shop cart empty** will be noticed.
    - The renting price of each car according with rental period time will be showed on payment page.
    - The final rental price will be showed on payment page.
    - Vehicles become unavailable if the date of the last mandatory **inspection** is greater than 1 year or if the date of the next **service** is expired.
    - After rental order done, the client will fin a button on top of website called 'Your cart' to get the page where he will be able to do the changes, check-out or cancellation.
    - In the bottom of car page there is a **'Related products'** section where client will see some of other similar cars. If he refresh the page this examples will change randomly.  
    - The **payment page** is not official so is not needed to fill the payment card numbers. Just the form of payment is mandatory to register all the payments done by the platform.
    - During the car rental period the car is not available on website until it finishes.
    - In database all movements will be correctly registered, like form of payment, rental values, all the users, orders and cars will be matched when a rental is done.

I hope you enjoy my site as much as I did! :)
